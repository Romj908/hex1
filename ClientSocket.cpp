        EADDRNOTAVAIL
              The specified address is not available from the local machine.

       EAFNOSUPPORT
              The specified address is not a valid address for the address
              family of the specified socket.

       EALREADY
              A connection request is already in progress for the specified
              socket.

       EBADF  The socket argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       ECONNREFUSED
              The target address was not listening for connections or
              refused the connection request.

       EINPROGRESS
              O_NONBLOCK is set for the file descriptor for the socket and
              the connection cannot be immediately established; the
              connection shall be established asynchronously.

       EINTR  The attempt to establish a connection was interrupted by
              delivery of a signal that was caught; the connection shall be
              established asynchronously.

       EISCONN
              The specified socket is connection-mode and is already
              connected.

       ENETUNREACH
              No route to the network is present.

       ENOTSOCK
              The socket argument does not refer to a socket.

       EPROTOTYPE
              The specified address has a different type than the socket
              bound to the specified peer address.

       ETIMEDOUT
              The attempt to connect timed out before a connection was made.

       If the address family of the socket is AF_UNIX, then connect() shall
       fail if:

       EIO    An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
              file system.

       ELOOP  A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution
              of the pathname in address.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
              {NAME_MAX}.

       ENOENT A component of the pathname does not name an existing file or
              the pathname is an empty string.

       ENOTDIR
              A component of the path prefix of the pathname in address
              names an existing file that is neither a directory nor a
              symbolic link to a directory, or the pathname in address
              contains at least one non-<slash> character and ends with one
              or more trailing <slash> characters and the last pathname
              component names an existing file that is neither a directory
              nor a symbolic link to a directory.

       The connect() function may fail if:

       EACCES Search permission is denied for a component of the path
              prefix; or write access to the named socket is denied.

       EADDRINUSE
              Attempt to establish a connection that uses addresses that are
              already in use.

       ECONNRESET
              Remote host reset the connection request.

       EHOSTUNREACH
              The destination host cannot be reached (probably because the
              host is down or a remote router cannot reach it).

       EINVAL The address_len argument is not a valid length for the address
              family; or invalid address family in the sockaddr structure.

       ELOOP  More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered during
              resolution of the pathname in address.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
              resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate result
              with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       ENETDOWN
              The local network interface used to reach the destination is
              down.

       ENOBUFS
              No buffer space is available.

       EOPNOTSUPP
              The socket is listening and cannot be connected.
